    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>CreeperCraft is a little survival server on the Bedrock version of Minecraft, to join you need to put in <span class="font-mono">creepercraft.online</span> as the IP address and know the secret password off of one of us :)</p>
    <h1>Mods</h1>
    <p>The server will probably be <i>lightly</i> modded with some basic stuff to make the game more fun. Probably something like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Player head drops sometimes when someone kills you</li>
        <li>Maybe some kind of pipeline thing so we can make factories</li>
        <li>Trees falling over?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing too modded, it'll be basically vanilla!</p>
    <h1>Hardware</h1>
    <p>Right now it will be ran off of a DigitalOcean droplet with about 4GB of RAM, a decent CPU, and some storage. This will be enough to support like 5 players with no issues at all, 10 players will probs the the happy limit. In the future I'll buy a mini-pc which will be way better than a Raspberry Pi so we should be good for power.</p>
